## **Project Description**

---

This project investigates the intersection of multimorbidity and unmet social needs using electronic health record (EHR) data from a cohort of 7.2 million patients in England. By developing an ontology to systematically capture and assess social needs, the study examines their prevalence, patterns, and associations with multimorbidity. The findings aim to inform strategies for integrating social determinants into the management of multiple long-term conditions, addressing health inequalities and improving outcomes.
